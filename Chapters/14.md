# Data and Image Literal

### Basic Array Data
- Just like most programming languages, you can create an array of data by using the square brackets. This is the most basic form of a list.

```
let sectionData = ["red", "green", "blue"]
```

### Using Array with Index
- You can use that data by calling it's variable name with the index value inside brackets. Index values in programming starts with 0, so that's why 0 will take the first value.

```
sectionData[0]
```

### Setting Data Model
- Data typically has more than just a single value. In this case, we need the title and the icon. Let's create a data model for our rich data. This will be useful later on when we need to manipulate that data. This data will be of type Identifiable so that SwiftUI can do powerful stuff with it. However, it needs a default `id`, so we're going to use `UUID()` to automatically generate them. Like this, we don't have to worry too much about index values.

```
struct Section: Identifiable {
    var id = UUID()
    var title: String
    var text: String
    var logo: String
    var image: Image
    var color: Color
}
```

### Data 
- Now that we have a data structure, we need to input some data. Just like arrays, we're storing the values inside brackets. Each item will call the data model.

```
let sectionData = [
    Section(title: "Prototype designs in SwiftUI", text: "18 Sections", logo: "Logo1", image: Image(uiImage: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "Card4")), color: Color(#colorLiteral(red: 0.3647058904, green: 0.06666667014, blue: 0.9686274529, alpha: 1))),
    Section(title: "Build a SwiftUI app", text: "20 Sections", logo: "Logo1", image: Image(uiImage: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "Background1")), color: Color(#colorLiteral(red: 0.2196078449, green: 0.007843137719, blue: 0.8549019694, alpha: 1))),
    Section(title: "SwiftUI Advanced", text: "20 Sections", logo: "Logo1", image: Image(uiImage: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "Card2")), color: Color(#colorLiteral(red: 0.8549019694, green: 0.250980407, blue: 0.4784313738, alpha: 1)))
]
```

### Looping 
- Now we can go ahead and use the data that we just created. First, let's reference that data.
- Then, let's use a `ForEach()` to loop through the collection of items and return individual ones declared as item. With item, we can specify the variables from your data model.

```
ForEach(sectionData) { item in
    SectionView(section: item)
}
```

### Component Data
```
var section: Section
Text(section.title)
Image(section.logo)
Text(section.text.uppercased())
section.image
.background(section.color)
.shadow(color: section.color.opacity(0.3), radius: 20, x: 0, y: 20)
```
